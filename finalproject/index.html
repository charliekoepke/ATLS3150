                    <blockquote>
                        "Universal Design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, 
                        understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, 
                        ability or disability. An environment (or any building, product, or service in that environment) 
                        should be designed to meet the needs of all people who wish to use it. This is not a special 
                        requirement, for the benefit of only a minority of the population. It is a fundamental condition 
                        of good design. If an environment is accessible, usable, convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone 
                        benefits. By considering the diverse needs and abilities of all throughout the design process, 
                        universal design creates products, services and environments that meet peoples' needs. Simply put, 
                        universal design is good design."

                    Not only does having something be accessible open up more people who are willing to visit, or buy, or 
                    look at a product or website, but it's also should be a common courtesy. It doesn't take anything 
                    away from those who are not impaired, and it might even help non-impaired inviduals. An example 
                    is subtitles on videos. These were originall made for those who are deaf or hearing impaired, but 
                    there are also many people who aren't hearing impaired that use subtitles in order to better 
                    understand a video.

                <p>
                    A simple way to start using Universal Design is to make websites, or products, accessible for those 
                    with disabilities. Many websites aren't accessible for people who are visually impaired, and 
                    many of them contain confusing structure that is hard to read for screen readers, or the colour 
                    contrast is hard for these inviduals.
