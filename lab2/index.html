                EarthBound, released in Japan as Mother 2: Gīgu no Gyakushū is a role-playing 
                video game developed by Ape Inc. and HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the 
                Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The second entry in the Mother series, it was first released in 
                Japan in August 1994, and in North America in June 1995. As Ness and his party of four, Paula, Jeff and 
                Poo, the player travels the world to collect melodies from eight Sanctuaries in order to defeat the 
                universal cosmic destroyer Giygas.

                EarthBound had a lengthy development period that spanned five years. 
                Its returning staff from Mother (1989) included writer/director Shigesato Itoi and lead programmer 
                Satoru Iwata, as well as composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka, who incorporated a diverse range 
                of styles into the soundtrack, including salsa, reggae, and dub. Most of the other staff members had 
                not worked on the original Mother, and the game came under repeated threats of cancellation until 
                wata joined the team. Originally scheduled for release in January 1993, the game was completed 
                around May 1994.

                Themed around an idiosyncratic portrayal of Americana and Western culture, 
                EarthBound subverted popular role-playing game traditions by featuring a modern setting while 
                parodying numerous staples of the genre. Itoi wanted the game to reach non-gamers with its 
                intentionally goofy tone; for example, the player uses items such as the Pencil Eraser to 
                remove pencil statues, experiences in-game hallucinations, and battles piles of vomit, taxi cabs, 
                and walking nooses. For its American release, the game was marketed with a $2 million promotional 
                campaign that sardonically proclaimed "this game stinks". The game's puns and humor were reworked 
                by localizer Marcus Lindblom. Since the original Mother had not been released outside Japan, 
                the title was changed from Mother 2 to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to.

                Although it was positively received by Japanese audiences, EarthBound sold poorly in the U.S. 
                Journalists attributed this to a combination of its simple graphics, satirical marketing campaign, 
                and a lack of market interest in the genre. In the ensuing years, a dedicated fan community spawned 
                that advocated for the series' recognition, particularly after Ness appeared as a playable character 
                in the Super Smash Bros. series. By the 2000s, the game had become regarded as a "sacred cow among 
                gaming's cognoscenti",[3] with multiple reader polls and critics naming it one of the greatest 
                video games of all time. It was followed by the Japan-only sequel Mother 3 for the Game Boy 
                Advance in 2006. In 2013, EarthBound was given a worldwide release on the Wii U Virtual 
                Console, marking its debut in territories such as Europe and Australia. In 2022, 
                EarthBound was released on the Nintendo Switch Online service, along with the original Mother game.
