## [Lab - The Basics](https://creative.colorado.edu/~chko6454/atls3150/lab2/)

> Find a reasonably lengthy wikipedia article (3-4 pages) and recode it using HTML5 semantic structure. Use anchor links in the navigation to link to the different sections. Use CSS to hide elements visually but not from screen readers and improve legibility.

## [Lab - Accessible CSS Layout](https://creative.colorado.edu/~chko6454/atls3150/lab4/)

> Create a multicolumn webpage with a header, nav, main, 2 asides, and a footer. Design using an external CSS stylsheet, using CSS grid for the main layout, and CSS flexbox for the nav layout. Use HTML viewport and CSS media queries to reorder and rearrange the elements for tablet and mobile devices. Include two imported [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), and an [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) colour scheme. Validate with the [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/), and test using a screen reader as well.
