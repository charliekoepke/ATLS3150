                EarthBound, released in Japan as Mother 2: Gīgu no Gyakushū is a role-playing 
                video game developed by Ape Inc. and HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the 
                Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The second entry in the Mother series, it was first released in 
                Japan in August 1994, and in North America in June 1995. As Ness and his party of four, Paula, Jeff and 
                Poo, the player travels the world to collect melodies from eight Sanctuaries in order to defeat the 
                universal cosmic destroyer Giygas.

                EarthBound had a lengthy development period that spanned five years. 
                Its returning staff from Mother (1989) included writer/director Shigesato Itoi and lead programmer 
                Satoru Iwata, as well as composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka, who incorporated a diverse range 
                of styles into the soundtrack, including salsa, reggae, and dub. Most of the other staff members had 
                not worked on the original Mother, and the game came under repeated threats of cancellation until 
                wata joined the team. Originally scheduled for release in January 1993, the game was completed 
                around May 1994.
            </p>
            <p>
                Themed around an idiosyncratic portrayal of Americana and Western culture, 
                EarthBound subverted popular role-playing game traditions by featuring a modern setting while 
                parodying numerous staples of the genre. Itoi wanted the game to reach non-gamers with its 
                intentionally goofy tone; for example, the player uses items such as the Pencil Eraser to 
                remove pencil statues, experiences in-game hallucinations, and battles piles of vomit, taxi cabs, 
                and walking nooses. For its American release, the game was marketed with a $2 million promotional 
                campaign that sardonically proclaimed "this game stinks". The game's puns and humor were reworked 
                by localizer Marcus Lindblom. Since the original Mother had not been released outside Japan, 
                the title was changed from Mother 2 to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although it was positively received by Japanese audiences, EarthBound sold poorly in the U.S. 
                Journalists attributed this to a combination of its simple graphics, satirical marketing campaign, 
                and a lack of market interest in the genre. In the ensuing years, a dedicated fan community spawned 
                that advocated for the series' recognition, particularly after Ness appeared as a playable character 
                in the Super Smash Bros. series. By the 2000s, the game had become regarded as a "sacred cow among 
                gaming's cognoscenti",[3] with multiple reader polls and critics naming it one of the greatest 
                video games of all time. It was followed by the Japan-only sequel Mother 3 for the Game Boy 
                Advance in 2006. In 2013, EarthBound was given a worldwide release on the Wii U Virtual 
                Console, marking its debut in territories such as Europe and Australia. In 2022, 
                EarthBound was released on the Nintendo Switch Online service, along with the original Mother game.

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>
                    EarthBound features many traditional role-playing game elements: 
                    the player controls a party of characters who travel through the game's 
                    two-dimensional world composed of villages, cities, caves, and dungeons. 
                    Along the way, the player fights battles against enemies and the party receives 
                    experience points for victories. If enough experience points are acquired, 
                    a character's level will increase. This pseudo-randomly increases the character's attributes, 
                    such as offense, defense, and the maximum hit points (HP) and psychic points (PP) of each character. 
                    Rather than using an overworld map screen like most console RPGs of its era, 
                    the world is entirely seamless, with no differentiation between towns and the outside world. 
                    Another non-traditional element is the perspective used for the world. 
                    The game uses oblique projection, while most 2D RPGs use a "top-down" view on a grid or an 
                    isometric perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike its predecessor, EarthBound Beginnings, EarthBound does not use random encounters. 
                    When physical contact occurs between a character and an enemy, the screen dissolves into battle mode. 
                    In combat, characters and enemies possess a certain amount of HP. Blows to an enemy reduce the 
                    amount of HP. Once an enemy's HP reaches zero, that enemy is defeated. If a specific type of enemy 
                    is defeated, there is a chance that the character will receive an item after the battle. 
                    In battle, the player is allowed to choose specific actions for their characters. 
                    These actions can include attacking, healing, spying (reveals enemy weakness/strengths), 
                    mirroring (emulate a specific enemy), and running away. Characters can also use special 
                    PSI attacks that require PP. Once each character is assigned a command, the characters and 
                    enemies perform their actions in a set order, determined by character speed. 
                    Whenever a character receives damage, the HP box gradually "rolls" down, similar to an odometer. 
                    This allows players an opportunity to heal the character or win the battle before the counter hits 
                    zero, after which the character is knocked unconscious. If all characters are rendered unconscious, 
                    the game transitions to an endgame screen, asking if the player wants to continue. 
                    An affirmative response brings Ness, conscious, back to the last telephone he saved from, 
                    with half the money on his person at the time of his defeat, and with other party members 
                    showing as still unconscious. Because battles are not random, tactical advantages can be gained. 
                    If the player physically contacts an enemy from behind (indicated by a translucent green swirl 
                    that fills the screen), the player is given a first-strike priority. However, this also applies 
                    to enemies, who can also engage the party from behind (in this case, the swirl is red). 
                    Neutral priority is indicated by a black swirl. Unlike other RPGs, the enemies are not killed, 
                    but only "made tame" (with the exception of Giygas). Additionally, as Ness and his friends 
                    become stronger, battles with weaker enemies are eventually won automatically, forgoing the 
                    battle sequence, and weaker monsters will begin to flee from Ness and his friends rather 
                    than chase them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currency is indirectly received from Ness' father, who can also save the game's progress. 
                    Each time the party wins a battle, Ness' father deposits money in an account that can be 
                    withdrawn at ATMs. In towns, players can visit various stores where weapons, armor, and items 
                    can be bought. Weapons and armor can be equipped to increase character strength and defense, 
                    respectively. In addition, items can be used for a number of purposes, such as healing. 
                    Towns also contain several other useful facilities such as hospitals where players can be 
                    healed for a fee.

                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p>
                    EarthBound takes place in the year 199X, several years after the events of Mother, 
                    in the fictional country of Eagleland, a parody of the United States. The player starts as a young 
                    boy named Ness as he investigates a nearby meteorite crash[9] with his neighbor, Pokey, 
                    to find his neighbor's brother Picky. They find that an alien force, Giygas, has enveloped 
                    and consumed the world in hatred and consequently turned animals, humans, and objects into 
                    malicious creatures. A small, bee-like creature from the future named Buzz-Buzz instructs 
                    Ness to collect melodies in a Sound Stone from eight Sanctuaries to preemptively stop the force, 
                    but is killed shortly thereafter when Pokey and Picky's mother mistakes him for a pest. 
                    On his journey to visit the sanctuaries, Ness visits the cultists of Happy Happy Village, 
                    where he saves Paula, and the zombie-infested Threed, where the two of them fall prey to a trap. 
                    After Paula telepathically instructs Jeff in a Winters boarding school to rescue them, they 
                    continue to Saturn Valley, a village filled with a species of creatures called Mr. Saturn, 
                    the city of Fourside, and the seaside resort Summers. Meanwhile, Poo, the prince of Dalaam, 
                    undergoes training called "Mu Training" before joining the party as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The party continues to travel to the Scaraba desert, the Deep Darkness swamp, another 
                    village of creatures called the Tenda and a forgotten underworld where dinosaurs live. 
                    When the Sound Stone is eventually filled, Ness visits Magicant, a surreal location 
                    in his mind where he fights his personal dark side. Upon returning to Eagleland, Ness and 
                    his party use the Phase Distorter to travel back in time to fight Giygas, transferring their 
                    souls into robots so as to not destroy their bodies through time travel. The group discovers 
                    a device that contains Giygas, but it is being guarded by Pokey, who has been aiding Giygas 
                    all along and is using alien technology. After being defeated in battle, Pokey turns the device off, 
                    releasing Giygas and forcing the group to fight[13] the alien, whose infinite power turning him 
                    into an incomprehensible embodiment of evil and insanity. During the fight, Paula reaches out 
                    to the inhabitants of Earth, and eventually the player, who prays for the children's safety. 
                    The prayers manage to exploit Giygas' fatal weakness – human emotions – and defeat the alien, 
                    eradicating him from existence. In a post-credits scene, Ness, whose life has returned to normal 
                    following Giygas' defeat, receives a note from Pokey, who challenges Ness to come and find him.
