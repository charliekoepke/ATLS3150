                    <blockquote>
                        "Universal Design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability. An environment (or any building, product, or service in that environment) should be designed to meet the needs of all people who wish to use it. This is not a special requirement, for the benefit of only a minority of the population. It is a fundamental condition of good design. If an environment is accessible, usable, convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone benefits. By considering the diverse needs and abilities of all throughout the design process, universal design creates products, services and environments that meet peoples' needs. Simply put, universal design is good design."

                <h3>The 7 Principles of Universal Design</h3>
                <p>
                    The 7 principles of universal design are equitable use, flexible use, intuitive use, perceptible information, tolerance for error, low physical effort, and size and space approach for use.
                </p>
                <h4>Equitable Use</h4>
                <p>
                    Is the design something that is useful to people with diverse abilities, while also being something that can be marketable? An equitable design should provide the same means of use for all users, so it can avoid segregation. Privacy and security should also be accessible and useable for users, while also having an appealing design.
                </p>
                <h4>Flexibility in Use</h4>
                <p>
                    Is the design able to accommodate a wide range of individuals with different preferences and abilities? A flexible design should provide a choice of methods for users to choose from, such as including right-handed and left-handed options. The design should also help with the user’s accuracy and precision and provide adaptability for the user.
                </p>
                <h4>Simple and Intuitive Use</h4>
                <p>
                    Is the design easy to use and understand, regardless of a user’s background? The simple and intuitive design should eliminate any unnecessary complexities and be intuitive for users. Consistency is also important, as well as giving the user feedback when they encounter an error.
                </p>
                <h4>Perceptible Information</h4>
                <p>
                    Does the design communicate the necessary information to the user even with limits to the user’s sensory abilities? A design the makes use of perceptible information should use different modes of presenting information to the user. While it might be redundant, it is extremely important for those who might not have limited sensory abilities. The information presented should be legible, for reading, provide adequate contrast between essential information and its surroundings, and differentiate elements in ways that can be described.
                </p>
                <h4>Tolerance for Error</h4>
                <p>
                    Does the design minimize hazards and possible errors for when users make accidental or unintended actions? A design that has a tolerance for error should arrange the elements in a way that minimizes the number of errors a user might encounter. It should provide a warning of errors, if there are any that the user runs into, and should provide fail safe features for when mistakes happen.
                </p>
                <h4>Low PHysical Effort</h4>
                <p>
                    Is the design comfortable to use even with a minimum of fatigue? A low physical effort design should allow the user to maintain a neutral body position, use reasonable operating forces, and minimize repetitive actions or actions that require sustained physical effort.
                </p>
                <h4>Size and Space for Approach and Use</h4>
                <p>
                    Does the design have the appropriate size for its space and usage? A design that utilizes size and space for its approach should provide a clear line of sight to important elements that the user will need to use, regardless of if a user is seated or standing or in another position. All the components should also be reachable regardless of the user’s position. There should be accommodations for varying body and hand sizes and provide adequate space for those who might require assistive devices or personal assistance.
