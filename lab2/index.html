                EarthBound, released in Japan as Mother 2: Gīgu no Gyakushū is a role-playing 
                video game developed by Ape Inc. and HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the 
                Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The second entry in the Mother series, it was first released in 
                Japan in August 1994, and in North America in June 1995. As Ness and his party of four, Paula, Jeff and 
                Poo, the player travels the world to collect melodies from eight Sanctuaries in order to defeat the 
                universal cosmic destroyer Giygas.

                EarthBound had a lengthy development period that spanned five years. 
                Its returning staff from Mother (1989) included writer/director Shigesato Itoi and lead programmer 
                Satoru Iwata, as well as composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka, who incorporated a diverse range 
                of styles into the soundtrack, including salsa, reggae, and dub. Most of the other staff members had 
                not worked on the original Mother, and the game came under repeated threats of cancellation until 
                wata joined the team. Originally scheduled for release in January 1993, the game was completed 
                around May 1994.
            </p>
            <p>
                Themed around an idiosyncratic portrayal of Americana and Western culture, 
                EarthBound subverted popular role-playing game traditions by featuring a modern setting while 
                parodying numerous staples of the genre. Itoi wanted the game to reach non-gamers with its 
                intentionally goofy tone; for example, the player uses items such as the Pencil Eraser to 
                remove pencil statues, experiences in-game hallucinations, and battles piles of vomit, taxi cabs, 
                and walking nooses. For its American release, the game was marketed with a $2 million promotional 
                campaign that sardonically proclaimed "this game stinks". The game's puns and humor were reworked 
                by localizer Marcus Lindblom. Since the original Mother had not been released outside Japan, 
                the title was changed from Mother 2 to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although it was positively received by Japanese audiences, EarthBound sold poorly in the U.S. 
                Journalists attributed this to a combination of its simple graphics, satirical marketing campaign, 
                and a lack of market interest in the genre. In the ensuing years, a dedicated fan community spawned 
                that advocated for the series' recognition, particularly after Ness appeared as a playable character 
                in the Super Smash Bros. series. By the 2000s, the game had become regarded as a "sacred cow among 
                gaming's cognoscenti",[3] with multiple reader polls and critics naming it one of the greatest 
                video games of all time. It was followed by the Japan-only sequel Mother 3 for the Game Boy 
                Advance in 2006. In 2013, EarthBound was given a worldwide release on the Wii U Virtual 
                Console, marking its debut in territories such as Europe and Australia. In 2022, 
                EarthBound was released on the Nintendo Switch Online service, along with the original Mother game.

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>
                    EarthBound features many traditional role-playing game elements: 
                    the player controls a party of characters who travel through the game's 
                    two-dimensional world composed of villages, cities, caves, and dungeons. 
                    Along the way, the player fights battles against enemies and the party receives 
                    experience points for victories. If enough experience points are acquired, 
                    a character's level will increase. This pseudo-randomly increases the character's attributes, 
                    such as offense, defense, and the maximum hit points (HP) and psychic points (PP) of each character. 
                    Rather than using an overworld map screen like most console RPGs of its era, 
                    the world is entirely seamless, with no differentiation between towns and the outside world. 
                    Another non-traditional element is the perspective used for the world. 
                    The game uses oblique projection, while most 2D RPGs use a "top-down" view on a grid or an 
                    isometric perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike its predecessor, EarthBound Beginnings, EarthBound does not use random encounters. 
                    When physical contact occurs between a character and an enemy, the screen dissolves into battle mode. 
                    In combat, characters and enemies possess a certain amount of HP. Blows to an enemy reduce the 
                    amount of HP. Once an enemy's HP reaches zero, that enemy is defeated. If a specific type of enemy 
                    is defeated, there is a chance that the character will receive an item after the battle. 
                    In battle, the player is allowed to choose specific actions for their characters. 
                    These actions can include attacking, healing, spying (reveals enemy weakness/strengths), 
                    mirroring (emulate a specific enemy), and running away. Characters can also use special 
                    PSI attacks that require PP. Once each character is assigned a command, the characters and 
                    enemies perform their actions in a set order, determined by character speed. 
                    Whenever a character receives damage, the HP box gradually "rolls" down, similar to an odometer. 
                    This allows players an opportunity to heal the character or win the battle before the counter hits 
                    zero, after which the character is knocked unconscious. If all characters are rendered unconscious, 
                    the game transitions to an endgame screen, asking if the player wants to continue. 
                    An affirmative response brings Ness, conscious, back to the last telephone he saved from, 
                    with half the money on his person at the time of his defeat, and with other party members 
                    showing as still unconscious. Because battles are not random, tactical advantages can be gained. 
                    If the player physically contacts an enemy from behind (indicated by a translucent green swirl 
                    that fills the screen), the player is given a first-strike priority. However, this also applies 
                    to enemies, who can also engage the party from behind (in this case, the swirl is red). 
                    Neutral priority is indicated by a black swirl. Unlike other RPGs, the enemies are not killed, 
                    but only "made tame" (with the exception of Giygas). Additionally, as Ness and his friends 
                    become stronger, battles with weaker enemies are eventually won automatically, forgoing the 
                    battle sequence, and weaker monsters will begin to flee from Ness and his friends rather 
                    than chase them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currency is indirectly received from Ness' father, who can also save the game's progress. 
                    Each time the party wins a battle, Ness' father deposits money in an account that can be 
                    withdrawn at ATMs. In towns, players can visit various stores where weapons, armor, and items 
                    can be bought. Weapons and armor can be equipped to increase character strength and defense, 
                    respectively. In addition, items can be used for a number of purposes, such as healing. 
                    Towns also contain several other useful facilities such as hospitals where players can be 
                    healed for a fee.

                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p>
                    EarthBound takes place in the year 199X, several years after the events of Mother, 
                    in the fictional country of Eagleland, a parody of the United States. The player starts as a young 
                    boy named Ness as he investigates a nearby meteorite crash[9] with his neighbor, Pokey, 
                    to find his neighbor's brother Picky. They find that an alien force, Giygas, has enveloped 
                    and consumed the world in hatred and consequently turned animals, humans, and objects into 
                    malicious creatures. A small, bee-like creature from the future named Buzz-Buzz instructs 
                    Ness to collect melodies in a Sound Stone from eight Sanctuaries to preemptively stop the force, 
                    but is killed shortly thereafter when Pokey and Picky's mother mistakes him for a pest. 
                    On his journey to visit the sanctuaries, Ness visits the cultists of Happy Happy Village, 
                    where he saves Paula, and the zombie-infested Threed, where the two of them fall prey to a trap. 
                    After Paula telepathically instructs Jeff in a Winters boarding school to rescue them, they 
                    continue to Saturn Valley, a village filled with a species of creatures called Mr. Saturn, 
                    the city of Fourside, and the seaside resort Summers. Meanwhile, Poo, the prince of Dalaam, 
                    undergoes training called "Mu Training" before joining the party as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The party continues to travel to the Scaraba desert, the Deep Darkness swamp, another 
                    village of creatures called the Tenda and a forgotten underworld where dinosaurs live. 
                    When the Sound Stone is eventually filled, Ness visits Magicant, a surreal location 
                    in his mind where he fights his personal dark side. Upon returning to Eagleland, Ness and 
                    his party use the Phase Distorter to travel back in time to fight Giygas, transferring their 
                    souls into robots so as to not destroy their bodies through time travel. The group discovers 
                    a device that contains Giygas, but it is being guarded by Pokey, who has been aiding Giygas 
                    all along and is using alien technology. After being defeated in battle, Pokey turns the device off, 
                    releasing Giygas and forcing the group to fight[13] the alien, whose infinite power turning him 
                    into an incomprehensible embodiment of evil and insanity. During the fight, Paula reaches out 
                    to the inhabitants of Earth, and eventually the player, who prays for the children's safety. 
                    The prayers manage to exploit Giygas' fatal weakness – human emotions – and defeat the alien, 
                    eradicating him from existence. In a post-credits scene, Ness, whose life has returned to normal 
                    following Giygas' defeat, receives a note from Pokey, who challenges Ness to come and find him.

                <p>
                    The first Mother was released for the NES in 1989.[14] Its sequel, Mother 2, or EarthBound, 
                    was developed over five years[5] by Ape and HAL, and published through Nintendo. The game was 
                    written and designed by Japanese author, musician, and advertiser Shigesato Itoi, and produced 
                    by Satoru Iwata, who became Nintendo's president and CEO. Mother 2 was made with a development 
                    team different from that of the original game, and most of its members were unmarried 
                    and willing to work all night on the project. Mother 2's development took much longer than 
                    planned and came under repeated threat of cancellation. Itoi has said that the project's 
                    dire straits were resolved when Iwata joined the team. Ape's programming team had more members 
                    than HAL on the project. The HAL team (led by lead programmer Iwata) worked on the game 
                    programming, while the Ape team (led by lead programmer Kouji Malta) worked on specific data, 
                    such as the text and maps. They spent biweekly retreats together at the HAL office in 
                    view of Mount Fuji.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game continues Mother's story in that Giygas reappears as the antagonist (and thus did 
                    not die at the end of Mother) and the player has the option of choosing whether to 
                    continue the protagonist's story by choosing whether to name their player-character 
                    the same as the original. He considered interstellar and interplanetary space travel 
                    instead of the confines of a single planet in the new game. After four months, Itoi 
                    scrapped the idea as cliché. Itoi sought to make a game that would appeal to populations 
                    that were playing games less, such as girls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Mother series titles are built on what Itoi considered "reckless wildness", where he would 
                    offer ideas that encouraged his staff to contribute new ways of portraying scenes in the video 
                    game medium.[11] He saw the titles foremost as games and not "big scenario scripts". 
                    Itoi has said that he wanted the player to feel emotions such as "distraught" when playing the game. 
                    The game's writing was intentionally "quirky and goofy" in character, and written in the 
                    Japanese kana script so as to give dialogue a conversational feel. Itoi thought of the 
                    default player-character names when he did not like his team's suggestions. Many of the 
                    characters were based on real-life personalities. For instance, the desert miners were 
                    modeled on specific executives from a Japanese construction company. The final battle 
                    dialogue with Giygas was based on Itoi's recollections of a traumatic scene 
                    from the Shintoho film The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty that he had 
                    accidentally seen in his childhood. Itoi referred to the battle background animations 
                    as a "video drug". The same specialist made nearly 200 of these animations, working solely on 
                    backgrounds for two years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea for the rolling HP meter began with pachinko balls that would drop balls off 
                    the screen upon being hit. This did not work as well for characters with high health. 
                    Instead, around 1990, they chose an odometer-style hit points counter. The bicycle was one 
                    of the harder elements to implement—it used controls similar to a tank before it was tweaked. 
                    Iwata felt that the Ape programmers were particularly willing to tackle such challenges. 
                    The programmers also found difficulty implementing the in-game delivery service, where the 
                    delivery person had to navigate around obstacles to reach the player. They thought it would 
                    be funny to have the delivery person run through obstacles in a hurry on his way off-screen. 
                    The unusual maps laid out with diagonal streets in oblique projection required extra attention 
                    from the artists. Itoi specifically chose against having an overworld map, and didn't want to 
                    artificially distinguish between towns and other areas. Instead, he worked to make each town unique. 
                    His own favorite town was Threed, though it was Summers before then.

                    Mother 2 was designed to fit within an eight-megabit limit, but was expanded in size and 
                    scope twice: first to 12 megabits and second to 24 megabits. The game was originally scheduled 
                    for release in January 1993 on a 12 megabit cartridge. It was finished around May 1994 and the 
                    Japanese release was set for August 27, 1994. With the extra few months, the team played the 
                    game and added small, personal touches. Itoi told Weekly Famitsu that Shigeru Miyamoto 
                    liked the game and that it was the first role-playing game that Miyamoto had completed. 
                    Mother 2 would release in North America about a year later.
                </p>

                    The game includes protection against piracy that, when triggered, increases enemy counts to 
                    make the game less enjoyable. Additionally, right before players reach the end of the 
                    pirated copy's story, their game resets and deletes its saved file in an act that IGN declared 
                    "arguably the most devious and notorious example of 'creative' copy protection".

                    Mother composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka returned to make the EarthBound soundtrack, 
                    along with newcomers Hiroshi Kanazu and Toshiyuki Ueno. In comparison with Mother, Itoi said that 
                    EarthBound had more "jazzy" pieces. Suzuki told Weekly Famitsu that the Super NES afforded the 
                    team more creative freedom with its eight-channel ADPCM based SPC700, as opposed to the old 
                    Nintendo Entertainment System's restriction of five channels of basic waveforms. This entailed 
                    higher sound quality and music that sounds closer to his regular compositions. Itoi believes that 
                    EarthBound may be the first video game to use vibrato, or "string-bending", in its music. 
                    The soundtrack was released by Sony Records on November 2, 1994.

                    Suzuki's songwriting process, he would first compose on a synthesizer before working with 
                    programmers to get it in the game. His personal pieces play when the player is walking about 
                    the map, out of battle. Suzuki's favorite piece is the music that plays while the player 
                    is on a bicycle, which he composed in advance of this job but found appropriate to include. 
                    He wrote over 100 pieces, but much of it was not included in the game. The team wrote enough music 
                    as to fill eight megabits of the 24 megabit cartridge—about two compact discs.

                    According to Tanaka, the Beach Boys were repeatedly referenced between him and Suzuki, 
                    and that he would often listen to co-founder Brian Wilson's 1988 eponymous album while on 
                    the way to Suzuki's home. Suzuki has stated that the percussive arranging in the game's 
                    soundtrack was based on the Beach Boys' albums Smile (unreleased) and Smiley Smile (1967), 
                    which both contained American themes shared with Van Dyke Parks' Song Cycle (1968). To Suzuki, 
                    Smile evoked the bright and dark aspects of America, while Song Cycle displayed a hazy sound 
                    mixed with American humor and hints of Ray Bradbury, a style that he considered essential 
                    to the soundtrack of Mother. Tanaka recalls Randy Newman being the first quintessentially 
                    American composer he could think of, and that his albums Little Criminals (1977) and Land of 
                    Dreams (1988) were influential. While Suzuki corroborated with his own affinity for Harry 
                    Nilsson's Nilsson Sings Newman (1970), he also cited John Lennon as a strong influence due 
                    to the common theme of love in his music, which was also a prominent theme in the game, 
                    and that his album John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970) helped him to avoid excessive 
                    instrumentation over the SNES's technical constraints.

                <p>
                    The soundtrack contains direct musical quotations of some classical and folk music; the 
                    composers also derived a few samples culled from other sources including commercial 
                    pop and rock music. The texture of the work was partially influenced by some salsa, 
                    reggae, and dub music. Speaking about Frank Zappa's Make a Jazz Noise Here (1991), Tanaka felt 
                    that Zappa would have been the best at creating a live performance of Mother music, but could 
                    not detail Zappa's specific influence on EarthBound. Additionally, he felt that the mix tape 
                    Wired Magazine Presents: Music Futurists (1999) presented a particular selection of artists 
                    that embody the ethos of EarthBound, running the gamut from Space Age composer Esquivel 
                    to avant-garde trumpeter Ben Neill, along with innovators Sun Ra, Steve Reich, Todd Rundgren, 
                    Brian Eno, and Can. Tanaka also mentioned that he listened to the various artists compilation 
                    Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films (1988) heavily 
                    during EarthBound's development. Miscellaneous influences on Suzuki and Tanaka for 
                    EarthBound include the music of Michael Nyman, Miklós Rózsa's film score for The Lost Weekend 
                    (1945), and albums by various other pop/rock musicians.

                    As was traditional for Nintendo, Mother 2 was developed in Japan and localized in the United States, 
                    a process in which the game is translated into English for Western audiences. As the only game in 
                    the Mother series to be released in North America at the time, its title "Mother 2" was changed to 
                    "EarthBound" to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nintendo of America's Dan Owsen began the English localization project and converted about ten 
                    percent of the script before moving to another project. Marcus Lindblom filled Owsen's position 
                    around January 1995. Lindblom credits Owsen with coining some of the game's "most iconic phrases", 
                    such as "say fuzzy pickles". Lindblom himself was given liberties to make the script "as weird as 
                    [he] wanted", as Nintendo wanted the script to be more American than a direct translation would be. 
                    He worked alone and with great latitude due to no divisional hierarchies. Lindblom was aided by 
                    Japanese writer Masayuki Miura, who translated the Japanese script and contextualized its tone, 
                    which Lindblom positively described as "a glass half full".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lindblom was challenged by the task of culturally translating "an outsider's view of the U.S." 
                    for an American audience. He also sought to stay true to the original text, though he never met 
                    or spoke with Itoi. In addition to reworking the original puns and humor, Lindblom added 
                    private jokes and American cultural allusions to Bugs Bunny, comedian Benny Hill, and This Is 
                    Spinal Tap. Apart from the dialogue, he wrote the rest of the game's text, including combat, 
                    prompts and item names. As one of several Easter eggs, he named a non-player character for 
                    his daughter, Nico, who was born during development. While Lindblom took the day off for her birth, 
                    he proceeded to work 14-hour days without weekends for the next month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under directives from Nintendo, Lindblom worked with the Japanese artists and programmers 
                    to remove references to intellectual property, religion, and alcohol from the American release, 
                    such as a truck's Coca-Cola logo, the red crosses on hospitals, and crosses on tombstones. 
                    Alcohol became coffee, Ness was no longer nude in the Magicant area as seen in the image, and the 
                    Happy Happyist blue cultists were made to look less like Ku Klux Klansmen. The team was not 
                    concerned with music licensing issues and considered itself somewhat protected under the 
                    guise of parody. Lindblom recalled that the music did not need many changes. The graphical 
                    fixes were not finished until March 1995, and the game was not fully playable until May.

                    In Japan, Mother 2 sold 518,000 units, becoming the tenth best-selling game of 1994. EarthBound was 
                    released on June 5, 1995, in North America. The game sold about 140,000 units in the United States, 
                    for a total of approximately 658,000 units sold worldwide.

                    Though Nintendo spent about $2 million on marketing, the American release was ultimately viewed as 
                    unsuccessful within Nintendo. The game's atypical marketing campaign was derived from the game's 
                    unusual humor. As part of Nintendo's larger "Play It Loud" campaign, EarthBound's "this game stinks" 
                    campaign included foul-smelling scratch and sniff advertisements. At the time, Digital Trends 
                    described the campaign as "bizarre" and "based around fart jokes". GamePro reported that they 
                    received more reader complaints about the game's scratch and sniff ad than about any other 
                    1995 advertisement. The campaign was also expensive. It emphasized magazine advertisements 
                    and had the extra cost of the strategy guide included with each game. Between the poor sales and 
                    the phasing out of the Super NES, the game did not receive a European release. Aaron Linde of 
                    Shacknews believed that the price of the packaged game ultimately curtailed sales.

                    EarthBound originally received little critical praise from the American press, and sold poorly in 
                    the US: around 140,000 copies, as compared to twice as many in Japan. Kotaku described EarthBound's 
                    1995 American release as "a dud" and blamed the low sales on "a bizarre marketing campaign" and 
                    graphics "cartoonish" beyond the average taste of players. The game was released when RPGs were 
                    not popular in the US, and visual taste in RPGs was closer to Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI. 
                    While the game piggybacked on Itoi's celebrity in Japan, it became a "curio" for European audiences.

                    Most journalists attributed it to its simple graphics, atypical marketing campaign, and disinterest 
                    in the genre. Of the original reviewers, Nicholas Dean Des Barres of DieHard GameFan wrote that 
                    EarthBound was not as impressive as Final Fantasy III, although just as fun. He praised the game's 
                    humor and wrote that the game completely defied his first impressions. Des Barres wrote that 
                    "past the graphics", which were purposefully 8-bit for nostalgia, the game is not an "entry-level" 
                    or a "child's" RPG, but "highly intelligent" and "captivating".The Brazilian Super GamePower 
                    explained that those expecting a Dungeons and Dragons-style RPG will be disappointed by the 
                    childish visuals, which were unlike other 16-bit games. They wrote that the American humor was 
                    too mature and that the gameplay was too immature, as if for beginners. GamePro gave the game a 
                    mixed review, commenting that "[T]he lack a convincing storyline and the dull NES-clone graphics ... 
                    will make serious RPG fans a little cautious about approaching EarthBound". They said the 
                    "saving graces are the fairly good music" and "hilarious adult humor" but added that "the 
                    humor is too mature for little kids, and the gameplay is too immature for older gamers"

                    Lindblom and his team were devastated by the release's poor critical response and sales. 
                    He recalled that the game was hurt by the reception of its graphics as "simplistic" at a time 
                    when critics placed high importance on graphics quality. Lindblom felt that the game's changes 
                    to the RPG formula (e.g., the rolling HP meter and fleeing enemies) were ignored in the 
                    following years, though he thought the game had aged well at the time of its Virtual 
                    Console rerelease in 2013.

                    Reviewing the game years after its release, at least four writers described the game as "original" 
                    or "unique", at least two praised its script's range of emotions, and at least four praised its 
                    humor. IGN's Scott Thompson said the game teetered between solemn and audacious in its 
                    dialogue and gameplay, and noted its deviance from RPG tropes in aspects such as choice of 
                    attacks in battle. He found the game both "bizarre and memorable". Official Nintendo Magazine's 
                    Simon Parkin thought the game's script was its best asset, as "one of the medium's strongest and 
                    idiosyncratic storylines" that fluctuated "between humorous and poignant". GameZone's David Sanchez 
                    thought its script was "clever" and "sharp", as it displayed a wide range of emotions that made 
                    him want to talk to all non-player characters. GamesTM wrote that the game designers spoke 
                    with their players through the non-playable characters, and noted how Itoi's interests shaped 
                    the script, its allusions to popular culture, and its "strangely existential narrative framework".
                </p>
                <p>
                    At least three critics praised its "real world" setting, which was seen as an uncommon choice. 
                    Thompson noted its 1990s homage as "a love letter to 20th-century Americana", with a payphone as a 
                    save point, ATMs to transfer money, yo-yos as weapons, skateboarders and hippies as enemies, 
                    and references to classic rock bands. Official Nintendo Magazine's Parkin noted the theme's 
                    distance from the "knights and dragons" common to the Japanese role-playing game genre. 
                    Thompson noted the game's steep difficulty. He wrote that the beginning was the hardest and that 
                    aspects such as limited inventory, experience grinds, and monetary penalties upon death were 
                    unfriendly for players new to Japanese RPGs. He also cited the quick respawn time for foes 
                    and ultimate need not to avoid battles given the difficulty of bosses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At least two reviewers described the game's ambiance as cheery and full of charm. David Sanchez of 
                    GameZone thought the game's self-awareness added to its charm, where the player learned through 
                    the game's poking lighthearted fun. He added that the music was an "absolute delight" and 
                    complimented its range from space sounds to themes to "bizarre" battle tracks that varied 
                    with the enemy type. GamesTM wrote that the game's reputation comes from the "consistent ... 
                    visual language" in its Charles M. Schulz-esque character and world design. Kotaku's Jason Schreier 
                    found the ending unsatisfying and unrelieving, despite finding the ending credits with its 
                    character curtain call and photo album of "fuzzy pickles" moments all "wonderful".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thompson wrote that EarthBound balances "dark Lovecraftian apocalypse and silly lightheartedness", 
                    and was just as interesting nearly a decade after its original release. While he lamented a lack 
                    of "visual feedback" in battle animations, he felt the game had innovations that still feel 
                    "smart and unique": the rolling HP meter and lack of random battles. Thompson also noted that 
                    technical issues like animation slowdown with multiple enemies on-screen went unfixed 
                    in the rerelease. Parkin found the game to provide a more potent experience than developers 
                    with more resources and thought its battle sequences were "sleek". Nintendo World Report's Justin 
                    Baker was surprised by the "excellent" battle system and controls, which he found to be 
                    underreported in other reviews despite their streamlined, grind-reducing convenience. 
                    He wrote that some of the menu interactions were clunky. GamesTM felt that the game was 
                    "far from revolutionary", compared to Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, and that its battle 
                    scenes were unexciting. The magazine compared the game's "chosen one" story to a 
                    "throwaway Link's Awakening/Goonies hybrid narrative". Thompson praised Nintendo for digitizing 
                    the Player's Guide, though noted that it was technically easier to view it on another 
                    tablet rather than switching the Wii U's view mode. At least five reviewers concluded that the game 
                    had aged well.
